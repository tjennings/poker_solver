# Per-flop solving configuration
# Simplified config for tractable per-flop full game solving

name: "Per-Flop Solving"
stack_depths: [25]

# Preflop: simple raise structure
raise_sizes: [2.5, 8]
max_bets_per_round: 3

# Postflop: pot-size bet only, 1 bet per round
# This keeps the tree small enough to solve
postflop_max_bets_per_round: 1
# postflop_raise_sizes not set = use pot-relative sizing
